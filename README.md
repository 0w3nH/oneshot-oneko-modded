to install custom themes, find the renderer.js file inside of your vencord installation. if you cannot find it, try going to your vencord installation, then dist, then open it inside of a code editor like vs code, or notepad if you do not have one.

next, use ctrl+f to bring up the search menu, and search for oneko. once you find it, there should be 2 links. we are looking for this one: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adryd325/oneko.js/14bab15a755d0e35cd4ae19c931d96d306f99f42/oneko.gif

after, replace that with https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0w3nH/oneshot-oneko-modded/main/oneko-oneshot.gif and save the new file as renderer.js in the same "dist" folder.

lastly, restart discord with the vencore option in settings to apply changes.
